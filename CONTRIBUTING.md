# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to AI Ops Starter Kit.

## Workflow
1. Fork and create a feature branch
2. Keep changes focused and documented
3. Run local checks (`make doctor`, relevant scripts)
4. Submit PR with clear summary and validation notes

## Standards
- Prefer deterministic/idempotent automation behavior
- Document new configs in `README` or `docs/`
- Avoid committing secrets (`.env`, tokens, credentials)

## Commit style
- `feat: ...`
- `fix: ...`
- `docs: ...`
- `chore: ...`

## Reporting issues
Use GitHub issue templates and include reproducible steps.
